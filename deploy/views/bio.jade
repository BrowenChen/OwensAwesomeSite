					h1 My life so far..
					h4 I was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, briefly raised in Missouri, then spent the majority of my childhood in San Diego, California. I currently attend the University of California, Berkeley, where I am in my third year studying Computer Science, Cognitive Science. I’m actively involved in the UCJazz program, frequently gigging with my combos and trios (known as Saxadaisacal and CS^5), I’m an athlete on my university Triathlon team, a brother of Sigma Phi Epsilon Cal Alpha Chapter (or commonly known as Sigma “Tri” Epsilon), and dabble in as many random clubs as I can. 
					h4 I think a good general way to describe me is as an introspective introvert who loves to chase big dreams. 
					h4 I love getting tangled up in large-scale projects and get totally immersed in the state of flow, which is usually reached with the aid of some house, trance, EDM, or jazz music. I firmly agree with the latter side of the “Nature vs. Nurture” debate  (aside from physical limitations in athletics), and am a strong believer in a growth mindset. I currently strive to read as much as I can, and have recently committed myself to following my lost childhood passion to continue and pursue my musical aspirations. One day, I would love to be on the cognitive technology frontier and create an impact as a musician as well.

				h1(style="text-align: center;") Music
				.col-sm-6
					h4 Although I’ve been around music all my life, I took a 4 year hiatus that just recently been lifted this summer.
					h4 Jazz Fusion appeals to me because of the complexity, theory, and dedication required to learn such an esoteric language, and it’s definitely a long road ahead of me. 
						| My inspiration and influences include the fusion beast Tom Quayle, his young disciple Jack Gardiner, Andy Timmons, Pat Metheny, Joe Pass, Marco Sfogli, Joshua Redman, John Coltrane, and others. 
					h4 Thankfully, my mom started me on the violin at the young age of 5, and I can’t thank her enough for all the resistance she dealt with over the years. My classical background and experience in local symphony orchestras set me up very well to transition into flute in elementary school, percussion in middle school, and drum set for my high school jazz band.  I’ve also spent 4 years of my teen years building and amassing a youtube channel of 2,000,000+ video views and 7k+ subscribers through my “one-man-band” themed arrangement of songs that I produced. 
				.col-sm-6
					h4 I think the process of learning classical music really shaped my core personality traits in that I love seeing an end result and simply heading into the woodshed to repetitively grind out the work that I know I have to do.
					h4 Transitioning into the expressive and wide open world of improvisational jazz was/is pretty difficult, as I’m still just used to memorizing a passage and playing something note for note vs. spontaneous creation. It’s a weakness I notice in many aspects of my life, but I truly enjoy the learning process.

				h1(style="text-align: center;") Fitness, Technology, Life
				.col-sm-6
					h3 “Sound Mind, Sound Body”
					h4 The core values of Sigma Phi Epsilon, and what I strive for everyday. I believe that balance is the key to anything and exercise will always be a part of my life.  

					h4 Coffee and endurance sports are essentially my drugs, and I always love learning the biological explanations of why they work so well. I strive to follow a paleolithic, ketogenic food choices as well, not due to any “fads” going around but because of the truly interesting research and findings I read into a lot.  
						
					h4 I picked up running in 7th grade, after a family friend’s mom challenged her son to run 2 miles everyday for a month to see if he could do it. Naturally, I loved challenges like these in middle school and I ended up sticking to it for the next 6 years. High School Cross country was definitely a huge aspect of my life, and transitioning into the triathlon team here at Cal really opened a lot of doors for adventure these past few years.

				.col-sm-6
					h3 The last key constant in my life is technology. 
					h4 It’s crazy to see the rate of growth technology has impacted us with in the past decade. It’s also inspiring to know how once I master the tools in technology, I can create meaningful contributions that relate to what I love to do everyday. I view learning programming languages the same way as anyone learns a musical or spoken language - skills that grant access to new worlds of unlimited possibilities to explore. 
					h4 I’ve lately been particularly interested in cognitive, nano, and neuro technologies, primarily focusing on how to optimize everything in your life. Being able to adapt and learn quickly will be an essential skill as computer automation will take over many previous mindless tasks, and I’ve been a huge geek on stuff like spaced repetition, incremental reading, quantified self, speed-reading, and memory-related techniques. 

					.col-sm-8
						h4 The greatest thing about tech however, is that anyone has potential to change the world. I think the startup lifestyle really appeals to me because of the challenging demands it places on an individual, and that most entrepreneurs never do it for the money or fame. Being able to intern in London Techstars at a startup where I could focus on my interests in adaptive learning, and being surrounded by startups from all over the world really helped drive this message home to me. I enjoy the frugal, hectic, and demanding lifestyle as it really pushes you out of your comfort zone every day. It just makes the end rewards feel so much better.
